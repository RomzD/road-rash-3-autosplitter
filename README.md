v1 get time from memry which is calculated by the game and counts wrong delta while in game
v2(updated 06.05.21) Counts proper ingame time. UPD from 06.05.21 - fixed "small game time" bug
Both sometimes can be wrong by 0.1

Due to a lot of redundant 'm pretty shure code can be refactored in 20-30 lines. If you're able to do so, please feel free to commit better code.
