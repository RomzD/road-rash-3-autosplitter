# road-rash-3-autosplitter
#Unreliable. v1 get time from memry which is calculated by the game and counts wrong delta while in game    
#v2(updated 06.05.21) Counts proper ingame time. UPD from 06.05.21 - fixed "small game time" bug   
 
 
# If you're enthusiast i suggest you to use v2 autosplitter with debug in cooperation with "debug view" program to catch & fix bugs if there's any
